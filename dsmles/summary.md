Summary
=======

There is so much more to data science and machine learning. It isn't practical to cover everything in just these two libraries.

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

This is meant to be a practical introduction to these topics that is straightforward to use. The next level up involves machine learning frameworks like [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and often advanced computational hardware like GPUs. These tools allow great flexibility in building and training models, but they are substantially more complex and difficult to learn than what was presented here.

Hopefully you learned enough here to know if you can solve the problems you are currently working on, or if you need to continue advancing to higher levels. You might find the book on [data-driven modeling](https://pointbreezepubs.gumroad.com/l/pycse-ddm) a good next step.

Good luck on your data science and machine learning in engineering and science journey!
