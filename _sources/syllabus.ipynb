This may include topics in data visualization and modeling, differentiable programming, and the use of data and models to design experiments. The course will emphasize computational implementations of these topics using Python, with applications in chemical engineering. Students will need to be comfortable with scientific programming using Python. Students who have take 06-623 and/or 06-625 should have the skills needed in this class."

    "Each lecture will have a participation component. This will usually be an assignment in canvas, and may include reflection, quizzes, etc. These will be due within 24 hours of the lecture date.\n",

    "\n",
    "You are transitioning into a young professional at this point. That means assignments are done professionally too. In addition to the technical correctness of your work, we will also be assessing the professionalism with which it is presented. Each assignment will show the rubric it will be graded with at the top of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be a straight scale (no curve) so you will always know exactly what your grade is at all times. Each problem will be graded considering the approach used, the correctness of the answer, the neatness and quality of presentation, etc... Each category of the rubric will be given a letter grade that indicates your level of performance in that category.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A\" work has the following characteristics: The correct approach is used and the problem is set up correctly. The work is not over-simplified and it is easy to see it is done correctly. Any assumptions made were stated and justified. The answers are correct or only the most trivial errors are present, and were identified by the student. All of the correct units were used. The presentation is complete, clear, logical, neat and in order. Error analysis was performed if appropriate. Any figures used have properly labeled axes with units, and a legend if there is more than one curve. Essentially everything that should have been done was done and done correctly. This is the kind of work an employer wants their employees to do, and the kind of work you will be promoted for doing. You should be proud of this work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"B\" work is deficient in one or more of the properties of \"A\" work. It might be basically right, but essential details are missing such as units, or the presentation is sloppy. You will get by with this kind of work, but you should not expect to be praised for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"C\" quality work is deficient in more than two of the properties of \"A\" work. You would probably not get fired for this kind of work, but you may be notified you need to improve and you should not expect any kind of promotion. This is the bare minimum of expected performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"D\" work is not considered acceptable performance. Repeat offenses could lead to the loss of your job.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"R\" work is totally unacceptable performance. You will be fired.\n",
    "\n",

    "|C |0.6|\n",
    "|D |0.4|\n",
    "|R |0|\n",
    "\n",

    "Technical: 2/3 * 10 * 0.8 = 5.33\n",
    "Presentation: 1/3 * 10 * 0.6 = 2\n",

    "For a total of 7.33 points. That is between a B and a B/C for this assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the semester your final grade will be determined by the total points earned weighted by each category divided by the total possible points.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you earn 90% or more of the points you will get an A.\n",
    "If you earn more than 70% of the points, but less than 90% you will get a B.\n",

    "\n",
    "The deadlines on assignments are highly recommended times to turn assignments in by, because all of us need a schedule to do our work on, and if you don't follow them you will fall behind. I am not going to worry if you turn them in late by a few minutes or even hours. If you turn your assignments in late, Canvas will mark them as late, but there is no penalty for that.  At least up until we grade your assignment you can even turn in your assignment again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the solutions are posted, which usually happens after we grade them, then we will not accept late submissions.\n",
    "So there is some flexibility in being late, but it is not infinitely flexible, and the longer you wait, the more likely it is the solution will be posted and your assignment will get a zero for not being turned in.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Diversity, equity and inclusion at CMU \n",
    "\n",
    "We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We at CMU will work to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values. Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.\n",

    "Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:\n",

It is cheating to turn in someone else's work as your own. If you use code from the internet or the course notes, you should note this in your solution.
